Visual guide to every section of the OmniRoute dashboard.

---

## 🔌 Providers

Manage AI provider connections: OAuth providers (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI), API key providers (Groq, DeepSeek, OpenRouter), and free providers (Qoder, Qwen, Kiro). Kiro accounts include credit balance tracking — remaining credits, total allowance, and renewal date visible in Dashboard → Usage.

---

## 🎨 Combos

Create model routing combos with 13 strategies: priority, weighted, round-robin, random, least-used, cost-optimized, strict-random, auto, fill-first, p2c, lkgp, context-optimized, and **context-relay**. Each combo chains multiple models with automatic fallback and includes quick templates and readiness checks.

---

## 📊 Analytics

Comprehensive usage analytics with token consumption, cost estimates, activity heatmaps, weekly distribution charts, and per-provider breakdowns.

![Analytics Dashboard](screenshots/03-analytics.png)

---

## 🏥 System Health

Real-time monitoring: uptime, memory, version, latency percentiles (p50/p95/p99), cache statistics, and provider circuit breaker states.

---

## 🔧 Translator Playground

Four modes for debugging API translations: **Playground** (format converter), **Chat Tester** (live requests), **Test Bench** (batch tests), and **Live Monitor** (real-time stream).

![Translator Playground](screenshots/05-translator.png)

---

## 🎮 Model Playground _(v2.0.9+)_

Test any model directly from the dashboard. Select provider, model, and endpoint, write prompts with Monaco Editor, stream responses in real-time, abort mid-stream, and view timing metrics.

---

## 🎨 Themes _(v2.0.5+)_

Customizable color themes for the entire dashboard. Choose from 7 preset colors (Coral, Blue, Red, Green, Violet, Orange, Cyan) or create a custom theme by picking any hex color. Supports light, dark, and system mode.

---

## ⚙️ Settings

Comprehensive settings panel with tabs:

- **General** — System storage, backup management (export/import database)
- **Appearance** — Theme selector (dark/light/system), color theme presets and custom colors, health log visibility, sidebar item visibility controls
- **Security** — API endpoint protection, custom provider blocking, IP filtering, session info
- **Routing** — Model aliases, background task degradation
- **Resilience** — Rate limit persistence, circuit breaker tuning, auto-disable banned accounts, provider expiration monitoring, **Context Relay** handoff threshold and summary model configuration
- **Advanced** — Configuration overrides, configuration audit trail, fallback degradation mode

![Settings Dashboard](screenshots/06-settings.png)

---

## 🔧 CLI Tools

One-click configuration for AI coding tools: Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, OpenClaw, Kilo Code, Antigravity, Cline, Continue, Cursor, and Factory Droid. Features automated config apply/reset, connection profiles, and model mapping.

![CLI Tools Dashboard](screenshots/07-cli-tools.png)

---

## 🤖 CLI Agents _(v2.0.11+)_

Dashboard for discovering and managing CLI agents. Shows a grid of 14 built-in agents (Codex, Claude, Goose, Gemini CLI, OpenClaw, Aider, OpenCode, Cline, Qwen Code, ForgeCode, Amazon Q, Open Interpreter, Cursor CLI, Warp) with:

- **Installation status** — Installed / Not Found with version detection
- **Protocol badges** — stdio, HTTP, etc.
- **Custom agents** — Register any CLI tool via form (name, binary, version command, spawn args)
- **CLI Fingerprint Matching** — Per-provider toggle to match native CLI request signatures, reducing ban risk while preserving proxy IP

---

## 🔗 Context Relay _(v3.5.5+)_

A combo strategy that preserves session continuity when account rotation happens mid-conversation. Before the active account is exhausted, OmniRoute generates a structured handoff summary in the background. After the next request resolves to a different account, the summary is injected as a system message so the new account continues with full context.

Configurable via combo-level or global settings:

- **Handoff Threshold** — Quota usage percentage that triggers summary generation (default 85%)
- **Max Messages For Summary** — How much recent history to condense
- **Summary Model** — Optional override model for generating the handoff summary

Currently supports Codex account rotation. See [Context Relay documentation](features/context-relay.md).

---

## 🛡️ Proxy Hardening _(v3.5.5+)_

Comprehensive proxy configuration enforcement across the entire request pipeline:

- **Token Health Check** — Background OAuth refresh now resolves proxy config per connection, preventing failures in proxy-required environments
- **API Key Validation** — Provider key validation (`POST /api/providers/validate`) routes through `runWithProxyContext`, honoring provider-level and global proxy settings
- **undici Dispatcher Fix** — Proxy dispatchers use undici's own fetch implementation instead of Node's built-in fetch, resolving `invalid onRequestStart method` errors on Node.js 22
- **Node.js Version Detection** — Login page proactively detects incompatible Node.js versions (24+) and displays a warning banner with instructions to use Node 22 LTS

---

## 🖼️ Media _(v2.0.3+)_

Generate images, videos, and music from the dashboard. Supports OpenAI, xAI, Together, Hyperbolic, SD WebUI, ComfyUI, AnimateDiff, Stable Audio Open, and MusicGen.

---

## 📝 Request Logs

Real-time request logging with filtering by provider, model, account, and API key. Shows status codes, token usage, latency, and response details.

![Usage Logs](screenshots/08-usage.png)

---

## 🌐 API Endpoint

Your unified API endpoint with capability breakdown: Chat Completions, Responses API, Embeddings, Image Generation, Reranking, Audio Transcription, Text-to-Speech, Moderations, and registered API keys. Cloudflare Quick Tunnel integration and cloud proxy support for remote access.

![Endpoint Dashboard](screenshots/09-endpoint.png)

---

## 🔑 API Key Management

Create, scope, and revoke API keys. Each key can be restricted to specific models/providers with full access or read-only permissions. Visual key management with usage tracking.

---

## 📋 Audit Log

Administrative action tracking with filtering by action type, actor, target, IP address, and timestamp. Full security event history.

---

## 🖥️ Desktop Application

Native Electron desktop app for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Run OmniRoute as a standalone application with system tray integration, offline support, auto-update, and one-click install.

Key features:

- Server readiness polling (no blank screen on cold start)
- System tray with port management
- Content Security Policy
- Single-instance lock
- Auto-update on restart
- Platform-conditional UI (macOS traffic lights, Windows/Linux default titlebar)
- Hardened Electron build packaging — symlinked `node_modules` in the standalone bundle is detected and rejected before packaging, preventing runtime dependency on the build machine (v2.5.5+)

📖 See [`electron/README.md`](../electron/README.md) for full documentation.
